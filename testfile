My high school had installed a web filtering system that required you to log in to your browser at the start of a session. The login for students was simply “student” with no password. One day, by shear accident, I typed in “student\” and hit enter before realizing it. When it was accepted, I was curious: why did it accept me? Was I still logged in as a student? I tried going to ign.com– success! Espn.com– yes! I was given full permissions to the internet. I used it quietly at first, but of course when one kid sees you’re on a blocked site, they ask. Eventually most of the students in the school knew about it. One kid was even bragging that he discovered it; I was fine with that, because I knew if punishment came down on someone, I now had a scape goat. After a few months of blissful freedom, the software was patched and everything went back to normal. Everything except my attitude towards computer security, now that I saw it as potentially flawed the stage was set for something much more badass.
